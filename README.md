Biography of a Software Engineer: Mark Zuckerberg.

“Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.” [1]. Mark Zuckerberg said this in relation to the approach he took while creating Facebook. This quote is very similar to the methodology behind agile development, which is now the most used development process across the world.

Introduction
In this biography I will be looking at the life and achievements of Mark Zuckerberg and how he had shown to be destined for success from an early age. I will also be discussing his contributions to the software engineering world and discussing why I chose to write this biography on Zuckerberg.

Early Life
Mark Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984 in White Plains, New York [2]. Zuckerberg was interested in coding from a very young age. The first program that he wrote was a game for himself and his sibling to play. It was a game centred around the ancient roman empire in which you played against Julius Caesar. Although Zuckerberg claims that even he could not defeat his own game [3]. When Zuckerberg was in 6th grade, his father hired a software engineer, David Newman, to tutor Mark. In an interview with the New Yorker, Newman described Mark as a ‘prodigy’ and claimed that ‘it was tough to stay ahead of him’ [4]. Zuckerberg’s father ran a dental practice which he operated from their family home. Zuckerberg noticed that their communication processes could be improved and began to write a piece of code to do so. Zuckerberg called this program the ‘ZuckNet’ and it was a simple program that allowed for easy communication between the computers in the office. Amazingly, Zuckerberg was only 12 years old when he wrote this piece of code [5]. Similar programs such as slack are used all around the world in businesses today. When Zuckerberg was a teenager, he and friend Adam D’Angelo developed an app called Synapse which recorded every song that the user played on their computer and began to create playlists based on the music that the user liked. Zuckerberg and D’Angelo were offered almost a million dollars and a full-time job from windows media player, but they turned down the offer. They eventually made the app open source.

College Years and The Beginning of Facebook
As is already clear, Zuckerberg made several contributions to software engineering with his development of innovative apps such as Synapse and ZuckNet. However, his biggest contribution by far was the creation of Facebook. Zuckerberg came up with the idea for Facebook with friends Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes, all of whom were studying at Harvard at the time. Zuckerberg majored in psychology and computer science at Harvard [6], which he later dropped out of to focus on Facebook. Zuckerberg launched Facebook, which was initially called Thefacebook when he was in his sophomore year at Harvard. He initially was unwilling to invest money into Facebook and ran the website on an 85 dollar-a-month server that he could afford by running ads [7]. Zuckerberg says that he recalls sitting in his college dorm with his friends thinking that the world needed a worldwide application like Facebook. However, he never believed that he would be the one to do it [8]. Facebook started off as a service for Harvard students and a Harvard email was necessary to register for the site. In the beginning there were only simple functions such as add a photo, search, add friend and messaging, which Zuckerberg had coded. The site then expanded and by June of 2004 it had over a million users and was open to nearly all schools across the US and Canada [9]. In June 2004 Zuckerberg had dropped out of Harvard and had opened an office in Palo Alto, California. At that same time Facebook received its first outside funding, a five hundred-thousand-dollar investment from ex-PayPal executive Peter Thiel [10]. It was at this point that Facebook began its rapid ascent to becoming the world’s first, and biggest, social network. Nowadays, Facebook has over 2.6 billion monthly users which is almost a third of the world’s entire population [11]. 

Contribution to Software Engineering
As has already been discussed, Zuckerberg programmed and launched several applications and programs. But what relevance do they have to software engineering? The first contribution was the creation of ZuckNet. Although it seems to have been just a simple messaging program used by his father in his dental practice, some have described it to be a primitive version of AOL’s Instant Messenger. Although AOL had not based their program off the ZuckNet, it still shows us that from a young age Zuckerberg was developing programs that had not been created before. 
Of course, Zuckerberg’s big contribution to software engineering was how he developed Facebook. Facebook has a tradition of open sourcing its infrastructural tools and technologies. As a result, the whole software engineering community can benefit from developments at Facebook [12]. Of course, Facebook was the first of its kind, creating a market for social media in the world. As Facebook was the first form of social media platform of this scale, a lot of work had to be done to allow it to function with such a high volume of users. In the early days Zuckerberg was running Facebook on as many 85 dollar-a-month servers as he could afford. Facebook has come a long way since then and has developed technologies to handle 500% more traffic in the same amount of time on its servers which allows them to operate at such a high volume and still run quickly. These technologies are called “Hip Hop for PHP” and “Hip Hop Virtual Machine” [13]. 
The way in which Facebook allows their software engineers to work is another of the contributions that Facebook has made. After a 6-week training program run by software engineers, employees are allowed work on what they want to. They are told that the changes they make will be pushed live right away. They were told that a successful first week at Facebook would mean that you were able to show your family and friends a change you had made to the site. One engineer reported that their dad had called him to inform him of a problem with a drop-down menu. The engineer called his father back the next day to tell him that he had fixed the problem [14]. This way of working is a great example of how we can see the software engineering processes in Facebook and how they are applied in real world. It is common for software engineers to work this way by working quickly by fixing bugs and constantly adding to a site. However, this is more common in the early days of a project. Zuckerberg allows his engineers to always work freely and continue to make changes and updates to the site which is one of the many reasons why Facebook grew so fast and has remained to be the most popular social media in the world.

Why I Chose Mark Zuckerberg
There are several reasons why I decided to write a biography on Mark Zuckerberg. The first reason that I chose to write about Zuckerberg is because of how he began writing code at such a young age. Personally, I had never written a piece of code before I had started in college. I was intrigued when I read that he had produced the ZuckNet at just 12 years old. To write functional code at such a young age is an achievement on its own. But writing a program that was used in his father’s dental practice is more than impressive. Secondly, I chose Zuckerberg because I was interested to find out more about how social networks run. I have grown up with the availability of social networks, yet these apps have only been around for a very short amount of time. I have always taken for granted the ability to send my friends messages so easily on Snapchat, Facebook or Instagram. Obviously, mobile phones have been around for a while longer than these apps, but I find it fascinating that my generation were the first to have all these services available throughout our lives so far. As a result, I wanted to get more of an insight as to how the first worldwide social media was created.
